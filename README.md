# Raycast Engine
Simple implementation of a raycasting engine based on the DDA raycasting algorithm and using OpenFrameworks library.

This is a learning project and an experiment in software rendering as well as in game design using hand painted textures.
This work is very much a loose experiment and WIP, the code is not optimized or properly cleaned up.

Back in 1990's I was amazed by first 3D games on PC and Amiga. I always loved the look of software rendered 3D scenes and wanted to know how it was done.
Fortunately, these days all the knowledge is out there and the only thing missing is time to learn it all ;).

Maybe one day I will be able to code my own retro FPP game to fullfill childhood dreams.
